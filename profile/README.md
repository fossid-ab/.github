## Software Composition Analysis

[FossID](https://www.fossid.com) helps you find all open source software in your codebase no matter how it was introduced, identify license compliance and security vulnerability risks, and generate complete software bills of material (SBOMs) to meet industry regulations and customer demands.

### Maximize Developer Productivity. Minimize Business Risk.

FossID SCA tools provide the most comprehensive scanning capabilities, flexible workflow customizations, granular governance and administration, multiple reporting formats, and deployment options that offer maximum privacy and confidentiality.

### Highlights

- 🔍 **Complete Codebase Scanning:** Scan your entire codebase (not just declared dependencies) so you can detect all open source regardless of how it was introduced.
- 🧩 **Code Snippet Detection:** Find the smallest blocks of open source so your team can confidently leverage AI-generated code with visibility into license or security risk.
- ⚠️ **Vulnerable Snippet Finder:** Identify precise blocks of known vulnerable code so your team can remediate efficiently and leave no doubt about your security posture.
- 📑 **SBOM Management:** Ingest supplier SBOMs, consolidate and export NTIA-compliant SBOMs so you can easily meet regulatory security requirements.
- 🧑‍💻 **SDLC Integration:** Include SCA at the developer workstation, Git-based SCM, CI/CD pipelines, or issue tracking and notification systems.
- 💪 **Custom Workflows:** Use the Workbench web app UI, the CLI, or our API for maximum productivity.
